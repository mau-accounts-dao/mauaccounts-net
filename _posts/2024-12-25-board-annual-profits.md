### Resolution of the Board of Felines dated December 25, 2024

**Topic:** Recommendation on the Allocation of Annual Profits.  

**Content:**  

The Board of Felines recommends allocating 40% of the 2024 annual profit of MAU Accounts DAO for an airdrop distribution to MAU token holders (excluding undistributed tokens). Based on the market price of the MAU token as of December 24, 2024, the annual percentage yield (APY) is projected to be 289.81%. This measure aims to incentivize token holders and enhance the attractiveness of MAU tokens.  

For the development of MAU Accounts DAO, it is proposed to allocate 50% of the profits. These funds will be used to expand the DAOâ€™s activities, implement innovative projects, conduct marketing initiatives, develop new products, and enter new markets. This will enable MAU Accounts DAO to strengthen its market position and ensure long-term growth.  

The remaining 10% of the profits are planned to be directed toward enhancing financial stability. These funds will be allocated to increase over-collateralization for USDMAU tokens and other issued tokens, minimizing financial risks and improving liquidity.  

This profit distribution plan considers the interests of Participants, the strategic goals of MAU Accounts DAO, and the necessity of maintaining sustainable financial stability.  

The Board of Felines has proposed December 25, 2024, as the record date for determining accounts eligible to receive the airdrop.  

This resolution by the Board of Felines is submitted for review and approval through the MAU Accounts DAO Consensus Procedure.
