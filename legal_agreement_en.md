*Repository* — a technical system that supports centralized accounting,

### 2\. Subject of the Agreement

2.1\. The Participants entrust, and MAU Accounts DAO undertakes, to carry out the accounting of mutual obligations of the Participants in the form of records in registries, for which a technical system supporting the maintenance of a distributed ledger (hereinafter referred to as "Blockchain") or a technical system supporting centralized accounting (hereinafter referred to as "Repository") is used.

2.2\. As a rule, the accounting of mutual obligations is carried out based on the Blockchain, and the Repository may be used by MAU Accounts DAO as a backup method of accounting to prevent potential violation of the rights and interests of the contract participants in cases of technical and/or organizational necessity, including but not limited to cases of technical failures or unavailability of one or more Blockchains, as well as other circumstances where the use of the Blockchain is impossible and/or not acceptable.

2.3\. For the purpose of accounting, MAU Accounts DAO issues accounting units (hereinafter referred to as "Tokens") in the form of records in the respective registries, where a specific accounting unit serves as a measure of attaching a certain volume of rights corresponding to the obligations of the Participants, which can be implemented by presenting the Token through the appropriate record in the Blockchain and/or Repository. Information about the type, volume, method of performance of the obligation, persons obliged to holders of the Token, and other essential conditions for each type of issued Token must be mandatory placed and/or published on the Site, in the Blockchain, and/or Repository.

2.4\. MAU Accounts DAO organizes opportunities for Participants to exchange and mutually assign rights to mutual obligations using the technical means of the Blockchain and/or Repository. These opportunities may be limited in cases of:

    • requirements of international legal norms, as well as local jurisdiction norms related to the activities of the Participants, relevant decisions of jurisdictional authorities and regulators, compliance with which is mandatory for the Participants,

    • technical requirements and limitations of the used Blockchain and/or Repository,

    • obligations of Participants stipulated in the [Agreement on the Prevention of Unlawful Activities Using MAU Services and Agreements]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/legal_prevention_unlawful_en),

    • other cases specified in this Agreement and additional agreements between the Participants.

2.5\. In the case of using one or more Blockchains and/or one or more Repositories, MAU Accounts DAO undertakes to organize the possibility of transferring records of mutual obligations of the Participants regarding Tokens between available Blockchains and/or Repositories.

2.6\. MAU Accounts DAO shall not be liable for any losses or other issues that may arise as a result of MAU Accounts DAO's decision to maintain or not maintain a specific Blockchain and/or Repository.

3.2\. None of the rules of the Blockchain, Repository, and/or information system that facilitate the actual interaction of the Participants in the execution of this Agreement can per se determine the content of the mutual rights and obligations of the Participants under the Agreement and replace the conditions for their implementation established by the Agreement.

### 4\. Non-Financial Disclaimer

4.1\. Nothing in the definition of the obligations provided in the Agreement should be interpreted as recognizing these obligations as monetary or financial in accordance with the law of any applicable jurisdiction, and the relationships arising between the parties to the Agreement and/or resulting from the exchange and mutual concession of these rights should not be considered as settlement relationships.

4.2\. The abbreviation "USD" in the names of accounting units under no circumstances should be considered as related to any of the currencies of existing states, and in relation to the relationships between the parties to the Agreement, it implies a quantitative comparison of the volume of an obligation attributable to an accounting unit with the magnitude of gross domestic product attributed to one international dollar - a conditional financial unit applied in comparing macroeconomic indicators of different countries worldwide, as practiced by the UN (<https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/icp/ipc7_htm.htm>), IMF (<https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPEX@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/SAU>), and the World Bank (<https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114944-what-is-an-international-dollar>). Similar conditions apply to any parts of the names of accounting units that may be textually perceived as similar and/or fully or partially coinciding with the names of fiat currencies, trademarks, brand names, security tickers, etc. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties to the Agreement, none of this should be misleading or considered as a direct or indirect connection to similar entities with similar names.

4.3\. None of the parties to the Agreement has the right, within the framework of this Agreement, to exchange or settle accounting units for money, cash, currency, or valuable securities in any applicable jurisdiction.
