MAU Accounts DAO, together with the participants who have joined under this Agreement (hereinafter raeferred to as Participants), adhere to international legal norms, as well as local jurisdiction norms applicable to their activities, aimed at combating property crimes, illegal trade, money laundering obtained illegally, and hereby enter into this agreement on the following:

1\. For the purposes of this Agreement, Participants use the following definitions:

*Property crimes (crimes against property)* — attacks on property rights (such as natural property rights and other protected rights) and market relations, causing or threatening to cause harm in the form of actual property damage, offenses (socially dangerous acts) that entail the application of criminal liability measures against a person according to the legislation of different jurisdictions.

*Illegal trade*, according to the OECD definition, is the production or distribution of goods or services that a legislative body deems illegal. This includes trade that is strictly illegal in various jurisdictions, as well as trade that is illegal in some jurisdictions but legal in others. Based on this, the criterion of trade legality must be determined in each specific case of transactions between Participants based on which jurisdiction's legislation is applicable in this specific case. In a more general sense, illegal trade refers to transactions that directly cause unlawful damage to the protected subjective natural rights of Participants and third parties.

A *financial pyramid* is a fraudulent structure in which organizers attract funds from participants under the promise of high profit percentages and use the received funds for their personal interests. The income of the organizers and other participants of the pyramid is paid out using the attracted funds, without any investment or other entrepreneurial activities associated with the use of the attracted funds in a volume comparable to the volume that was attracted.

*Money laundering*, according to the OECD and FATF definitions, is the process of concealing or disguising the illegal origin of money obtained through criminal means in order to legitimize income acquired through dishonest means as a result of committing a crime.

• To exclude direct or indirect assistance to illegal trade and any other unlawful operations when using MAU Accounts DAO services and agreements;

• To exclude actions in their practical activities using MAU Accounts DAO services and agreements that may harm the fight against money laundering and the legalization of funds obtained through illegal means;
